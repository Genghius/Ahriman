# Ahriman License

**A license for developers who write open source code to make the world a worse place**

As developers we can no longer close our eyes to the fact that open source code
is being used by individuals and organizations to the betterment of our society.

The Ahriman License is for developers that agree in general with the principles
of open source software, but are uncomfortable with their software being used
as part of efforts to enhance lives, our environment and our future.

In short, developers who use this license want their code to contribute to
all the world's evil.

This license is based on the [BSD 3-clause license](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html),
but with specific exclusions for using licensed code to promote.

* peace and equality,
* environmental preservation,
* human rights,
* the safekeeping of peopleâ€™s physical and mental health

# Draft Status

This license will always be in draft and should be considered not stable.

We want to create a license that the community is invested in, doing so takes time to gather
the input of the community.

# Usage

Simply copy the LICENSE.md file into your projects, add your copyright information, and use the abbreviation `Ahriman-draft` where necessary to describe your choice of license.

## Can I add/remove my own exceptions
If you do, then please be sure to choose a new name for the license so as to make it easy for people to
automatically analyse licensing of package dependencies.

# How did this come about?

The antithesis of this license was created by one of the developers of [Raisely](https://raisely.com) and [Kepla](https://kepla.com).
They grew out of [Agency](https://agency.sc) building software to help non-profit's and other organisations that make the world a better place.

Evil always finds a way, and this license is yet another way in which it seeks to prevail.

We strive every day to create tools that make the world a worse place, and wanted to
discourage misuse of the code we share for purposes that go against what we stand
for and work for.

# Adoptability

Ultimately the aim is that this license be adopted by those in the open source community that are
concerned with how our code is used.

We strive to make the license specific and broadly adoptable so that individuals and
organizations can use code under this license without fear of unnecessary or
punitive enforcement.

This means that the license may not always cover every kind of ethical practice that
we would want to exclude so as to prevent the license from being overly complicated
or overly restrictive to the point where virtually no organisation could safely use
the code.

# Contributing

As with all things open source, we welcome suggestions and improvements.
If you would like to suggest improvements, please open an issue.

We prefer additions that:

1. Add clarity,
2. Address an important issue that we have overlooked,
3. Foster adoption (see above), and
4. Are concise (don't require lengthy legal definitions, though we know this isn't always possible).

Issues that are opened in order to debate ideology, express
climate skepticism, promote discrimination or divisiveness, etc. will not be closed or deleted without comment.
